# Ecommerce_data_warehouse


Overview
This SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) project is designed to transform an existing relational database, which handles various aspects of e-commerce operations, into a data warehouse. The data warehouse will be structured to support efficient querying and reporting for business intelligence purposes.

Project Structure
The project consists of several packages, each responsible for different stages of the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process:

Extract: Retrieve data from the source relational database.
Transform: Apply necessary transformations to cleanse, validate, and structure the data.
Load: Load the transformed data into the data warehouse.
